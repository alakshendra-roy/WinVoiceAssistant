listening_control.py

Decides *when* the pipeline is allowed to listen, so the mic isn't streamed
and acted on unconditionally and continuously:

  - Push-to-talk (PushToTalkController): mic capture only runs while a
    hotkey is held (default: Right Alt), or between two presses of a
    toggle combo (default: Ctrl+Left Alt+A). No hotkey engaged -> no
    streamer is even started, so nothing is captured at all.

  - Wake word (WakeWordGate): this one is a pure text-level gate, not a
    mic controller - some form of continuous local listening is
    unavoidable for any wake-word system (the mic has to be monitoring in
    order to ever hear the trigger phrase - this is true of Alexa/Google
    Home too, they just don't act on anything until the wake word fires
    locally). What WakeWordGate guarantees is that no transcript reaches
    the UI or the intent engine - i.e. nothing is *shown* or *acted on* -
    until an utterance actually starts with "animus" / "hey animus", and
    only the text after the wake phrase is forwarded.

class PushToTalkController:
    """Global hold-to-talk (default: Right Alt) + toggle (default:
    Ctrl+Alt+A), via a single pynput keyboard hook.

    Toggle detection is done by hand (tracking Ctrl/left-Alt modifier state
    plus the letter key's virtual-key code) rather than via pynput's
    GlobalHotKeys: on Windows, holding Ctrl+Alt changes how the OS resolves
    a letter key, so it often arrives as a bare vk-only KeyCode with no
    `char` set - GlobalHotKeys matches letter hotkeys by `char`, so it
    silently never fires for a Ctrl+Alt+<letter> combo. Comparing `vk`
    directly sidesteps that - but note `KeyCode.from_char(letter).vk` is
    *also* unreliable (pynput's Windows backend leaves it None), so the vk
    is derived straight from the documented Win32 constant instead: letter
    virtual-key codes equal their uppercase ASCII value (VK_A..VK_Z =
    0x41..0x5A), regardless of modifiers (verified against a real synthetic
    Ctrl+Alt+A press).

    The toggle's Alt is intentionally left-Alt only, distinct from the
    hold key (right-Alt/AltGr), so holding PTT and pressing the toggle combo
    can never be ambiguous about which physical key was meant.

    `on_start`/`on_stop` fire on transitions of a single "active" boolean
    that is true while the hold key is down OR toggle mode is switched on -
    so holding the key while toggled on, then releasing it, correctly keeps
    listening active until the toggle is pressed again.

    These callbacks run on pynput's internal listener thread, not the Qt
    main thread - callers must marshal them onto the GUI thread (e.g. via a
    pyqtSignal) before touching any widgets, the same rule that applies to
    IntentEngine's executor callbacks.
