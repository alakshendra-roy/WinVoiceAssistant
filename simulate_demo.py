"""
simulate_demo.py

Replays a scripted transcript (mimicking the interim/final events a real STT
backend would emit) through the same PillOverlay + IntentEngine pipeline used
in main.py, so the UI transitions and Windows automations can be verified
end-to-end without a microphone or any API credits.

Usage:
    python simulate_demo.py            # dry run: actions are logged, not executed
    python simulate_demo.py --live     # actually opens apps / browsers / camera
